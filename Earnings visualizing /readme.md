In this work, we'll explore how using the pandas plotting functionality along with the Jupyter notebook interface allows us to explore data quickly using visualizations.

The original data on job outcomes was released by [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/), which conducts surveys and aggregates the data. [FiveThirtyEight team](https://www.fivethirtyeight.com/) cleaned the dataset and released it on their [GitHub repo](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors).

We'll be working with a dataset on the job outcomes of students who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012.
* `recent-grads.csv` - Each row in the dataset represents a different major in college and contains information on gender diversity, employment rates, median salaries, and more.

Using visualization, we'll look at some of the questions from the data set like:

>Do students in more popular majors make more money?
* *Using scatter plots*

>How many majors are predominantly male? Predominantly female?
* *Using histograms*

>Which category of majors have the most students?
* *Using bar plots*
